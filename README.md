# Project dependencies.
Project depends on gnu make, clang and bear.
GLEW also depends on python, perl, libxmu, libxi, libgl and gcc. (X11 server package must download libxmu, libxi and libgl by default on most distros)
GLFW only requires cmake and libraries for OS and window system (installing X11 package with Xinerama should suffice)
